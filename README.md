# Customer Churn Prediction Project

Welcome to the **Customer Churn Prediction Project**, where we leverage machine learning techniques to analyze customer behavior and predict churn—helping businesses retain their customers and improve operational efficiency.

This project focuses on building an interpretable predictive model using **ensemble methods** such as Random Forest and XGBoost, along with **explainability techniques** like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). By identifying the key factors influencing customer churn, the model provides actionable insights to inform data-driven business strategies.

The dataset used in this project, `[online_retail_customer_churn.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hassaneskikri/online-retail-customer-churn-dataset?resource=download&select=online_retail_customer_churn.csv)`, contains anonymized customer data, including demographic information, transaction history, and subscription details. The project workflow includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, training and evaluating machine learning models, and implementing techniques to address class imbalance.

### Key Objectives:
1. Build accurate and interpretable machine learning models to predict customer churn.
2. Integrate explainability tools to provide clear insights into model predictions.
3. Address class imbalance using advanced oversampling techniques such as SMOTE.

This repository includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) scripts.
- Preprocessing and feature engineering pipelines.
- Implementation of ensemble learning models.
- Explainability visualizations using SHAP.
- Documentation of results and insights.

We invite you to explore this repository and provide feedback to improve our approach. Let’s predict and prevent customer churn together!
